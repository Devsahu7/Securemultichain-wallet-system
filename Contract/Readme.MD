## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a **trustless, decentralized, and interoperable wallet system** that simplifies how users manage assets across multiple blockchain ecosystems without compromising on security or transparency.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Secure Deposits & Withdrawals**: Users can safely deposit and withdraw ETH directly from the contract.
- **Multi-Chain Linkage**: Supports linking user accounts across multiple chains using wallet address mapping.
- **Event Tracking**: Transparent logs for deposits, withdrawals, and chain linking.
- **Owner Privileges**: Deployed contract ownership maintained for potential upgrades or protocol management.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🔗 **Integration with Layer-2 & Cross-Chain Bridges**: Enable asset transfers between Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.
- 🧠 **Smart Wallet Upgrades**: Add social recovery and multi-signature security.
- 📱 **Frontend DApp Interface**: Develop a React-based UI for easier wallet management.
- 🛡️ **Enhanced Security**: Add cryptographic verification for linked addresses.
- 💱 **Token Support**: Extend the wallet to handle ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.
